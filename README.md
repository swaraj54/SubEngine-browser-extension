Description:
SubEngine ðŸš€ is a browser extension designed to provide users with insights into the trustworthiness of websites they visit. Utilizing both AI analysis and user reviews, this extension aims to assist users in making informed decisions about the reliability of online content.

Features:
AI Analysis: The extension leverages AI technology to analyze the content of websites and classify them based on predefined rules.
User Reviews: Users can provide feedback on websites they visit, helping to improve the accuracy of the AI analysis.
Real-time Feedback: Receive real-time feedback on the trustworthiness of websites directly in your browser.
Simple Interface: With a straightforward interface, users can easily understand the classification of websites.

How It Works:
When a user visits a website, the extension performs AI analysis on the content to assess its trustworthiness.
Users can also submit their feedback on websites, influencing the classification based on their experiences.
The extension provides instant feedback, allowing users to make informed decisions about the reliability of the content they encounter online.

Assumptions:
The AI analysis is based on predefined rules and may not always accurately reflect the trustworthiness of a website.
User reviews are subjective and may vary based on individual experiences.
The extension assumes users are interested in evaluating the trustworthiness of websites they visit.

Conclusion:
SubEngine ðŸš€ aims to enhance users' browsing experience by providing insights into the trustworthiness of online content. By combining AI analysis with user feedback, the extension empowers users to make informed decisions about the websites they interact with.

Limitations:
The accuracy of AI analysis may be affected by the complexity and diversity of online content.
User reviews are limited by the number of users providing feedback and may not always represent the broader consensus.
The extension may not be able to analyze all types of content effectively, leading to potential inaccuracies in classification.

Version 2 (In future):

In Version 2, we plan to incorporate the following enhancements:
Reputation Analysis Enhancement: Integrate additional reputation analysis tools to provide more comprehensive insights.
Fact-Checking Integration: Strengthen fact-checking capabilities by expanding the list of fact-checking websites and improving extraction methods.
User Interface Improvements: Enhance the user interface to provide clearer visualization of analysis results and user feedback mechanisms.
Performance Optimization: Optimize performance for faster analysis and response times.
User Engagement Features: Implement features to encourage user participation and feedback submission, such as gamification elements or incentivized feedback programs.
Accessibility Considerations: Ensure the extension is accessible to users with disabilities by adhering to accessibility standards and guidelines.
Security Enhancements: Enhance security measures to protect user data and ensure secure communication with external APIs and databases.
